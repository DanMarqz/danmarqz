# Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel MÃ¡rquez and I consider myself a technology enthusiast as I am constantly studying and learning about this world.  

Currently my developments are focused on web solutions, both applications and sites, these applications can be CRUD for data management and visualization, all these solutions are based on JavaScript.

I find myself learning TypeScript so I can scale my applications from JS to TS and further develop my skills.
Once I know enough about TS I will focus my development on the Backend part which interests me and I want to develop to have a complete stack as a Developer. (Full Stack)

I know relational and non-relational databases (SQL and NoSQL) with which i'm worked frequently and it has not represented any difficulty for me.

Other programming languages that I know but could not fully develop are: Python, PHP and Java. Which I can easily adapt if necessary.

My expectation is to be able to grow and develop professionally in the world of technology as a Software Engineer, scale my learning in the Frontend as well as the Backend and never stop learning.
